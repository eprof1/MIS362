This folder contains local repos for all my courses that will be pushed out to:
https://github.com/eprof1
which is the eProfessor Code Repository.

This is a Private GitHub Education repository.
There will be one repo for each course, and the repo will contain all the student assignment files.

During the semester, assignments will be pushed from the eprof1 repo to the eprofessor repo.
The eprofessor repo will contain a repo for each course, and will be where students go to get assignments.


Notes: will need to add TA email address into js/constants.js file
