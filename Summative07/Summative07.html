              Some important points to consider are:<br />
              Creating a complex system, like developing a new product, is not a repetitive process.<br />
              The production process of manufacturing products, once 
they are developed, is a very well defined, repetitive process.<br />
              Continuous improvement aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of a defined process.

                  <p>Statistical Process Control techniques have successfully been applied to defined manufacturing processes.<br />
                  The goal is to reduce variation and improve quality. 
                      W.E. Deming was noted for his work in reducing variation in physical manufacturing processes.<br />
                  Software development and other complex, creative processes are not, and cannot be so well defined.<br />
                  The reason is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to define all of the significant process variables.<br />

                (50) 11.  What model is an alternative to the defined model for a creative process like software development?<br />
